<div class="article-title"><h1>Welcome to Minsk</h1></div>
<div class="article-text">Minsk will almost certainly surprise you. The capital of Belarus is, contrary to its dreary reputation, a progressive, modern and clean place. Fashionable cafes, impressive restaurants and crowded nightclubs vie for your attention, while sushi bars and art galleries have taken up residence in a city centre once totally remodelled to the tastes of Stalin. Despite the strong police presence and obedient citizenry, Minsk is a thoroughly pleasant place that's easy to become fond of.</div>
<div class="article-facts"><h3>Few facts</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>If you wish to be polite remember one simple thing: it’s Belarus, not Belorussia or Whiterussia. Got that? That’s it, now you’re one of the guys (or gals) and can enjoy the city.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not be surprised if you see the word Mensk from time to time. This is not a typo but the old name of the city and some people (we, for example) still use the name.</p></li>
<li><p>You can exchange currency at numerous currency exchange offices (if you are buying Belarus rubles, you do not need a passport), the local banks do not use any special secrets, commissions, or other cheating techniques and the exchange rate might vary, but not by much. There are twenty-four-hour exchange offices at the train station (3, Pryvakzajnaja Plošcha) and in the Minsk hotel (11/1, praspiekt Niezaliеžnasci), for example.</p></li>
<li><p>Until quite recently, you could only buy alcohol in Minsk until 10 p.m., but this rule was revoked before the latest presidential election. Bear in mind, though, that there are not that many twenty-four-hour stores in the capital, most close at 11 p.m. Few exceptions are Korona Zamok Mall (65, praspiekt Pieramožcaŭ) and Sosiedi Store (15, vulica Viery Charužaj) that are open till 2 a.m, Rublyovskiy (117, praspiekt Niezaliеžnasci) and Sosiedi Store at the Riga Mall (50, vulica Surhanava) that work 24/7.</p></li>
</ul>
